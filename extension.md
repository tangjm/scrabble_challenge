### Task

Given a word, compute the scrabble score for that word. Each `Scrabble` method should be no more than 5 lines and contain no more than 5 operations.

### Acceptance Criteria

```javascript
let scrabble = new Scrabble('')
scrabble.score() // => 0

let scrabble = new Scrabble(" \t\n")
scrabble.score() // => 0

let scrabble = new Scrabble(nil)
scrabble.score() // => 0

let scrabble = new Scrabble('a')
scrabble.score() // => 1

let scrabble = new Scrabble('f')
scrabble.score() // => 4

let scrabble = new Scrabble('street')
scrabble.score() // => 6

let scrabble = new Scrabble('quirky')
scrabble.score() // => 22

let scrabble = new Scrabble('OXYPHENBUTAZONE')
scrabble.score() // => 41
```


##### Letter Values

You'll need these:

| Letter                        | Value  |
| ----                          |  ----  |
| A, E, I, O, U, L, N, R, S, T  |     1  |
| D, G                          |     2  |
| B, C, M, P                    |     3  |
| F, H, V, W, Y                 |     4  |
| K                             |     5  |
| J, X                          |     8  |
| Q, Z                          |     10 |

Example
"cabbage" should be scored as worth 14 points:

- 3 points for C
- 1 point for A, twice
- 3 points for B, twice
- 2 points for G
- 1 point for E

And to total:

```
3 + 2x1 + 2x3 + 2 + 1
= 3 + 2 + 6 + 3
= 14
```
